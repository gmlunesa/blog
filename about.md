## Author

Hello, I am Goldy Mariz Lunesa, a software engineer at [NCR](https://ncr.com). My passions involve programming (_obviously_, I suppose) and space. Becoming an astronaut and exploring the infinity beyond has always been a dream of mine since I was a child, while developing software and making cool stuff out of computer machines are things  that I gained fondness for, as I studied in uni. I love animals! Fascination fills me and an urge to pet the cute ones always bugs me. I want to be a zoo/sanctuary keeper when I retire, it seems like such a fun job hanging out and making friends with animals. Another thing that I love is Mathematics. You name it, algebra, trigonemetry, calculus (integral, multivariate). It somehow serves as my escapism and in this world where the only constant thing is change, math and the formulas and algorithms don't seem to. It surely is fun and satisfying! 

My free time can usually be divided into two categories: productive free time, and (you guessed it!) unproductive free time. In productive free time, I code and add new projects to my [Github account](https://github.com/gmlunesa)  as well as experiment in the kitchen and clean the house. During those times where relaxation tempts me and I get to the dark side, I usually watch anime and The Office reruns, play some video games (current favorite: Don't Starve Together), read fantasy books, put on tinfoil hat and desperately type away another crazy theory in [r/asoiaf](https://reddit.com/r/asoiaf) as I impatiently wait for the sixth installment of George RR Martin's A Song of Ice and Fire.

Wanna talk or ask a copy of my resume? Please feel free to reach me at [gmlunesa@gmail.com](mailto:gmlunesa@gmail.com).

While you're here, why don't you read some of my [blog entries](https://gmlunesa.github.io/blog)?
